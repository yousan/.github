Points for Good issue
1. Set title simple and clearly
2. "Listing" is good method to write things
3. "Images" -- *Seeing is believing*
4. Set "Assignee" and "Estimate". Multiple Assignee may lead confuse who is responsible to the issue. Single assignee is recommended.
5. Use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Title e.g.
Calculate fee from multiple unit price by rooms

# Background
<!--
  Issue background.
  Why this issue is needed, what this issue solves.
  Screenshot is useful. Especially for UI (front) issue.

  e.g.
  We put a input form for unit price nad room number, received good reaction for clients.
  But the client calculate sum of price by manually.
  We want to improve their calculate.
-->

# What will be done
<!--
  Things to solve a issue.
  Free to write, but recommended "Checkbox listing" to clear out the things.

e.g. 
- [ ] Put "Calculate" button
- [ ] Calculate fee from multipled unit price by room numbers when clicked a button
- [ ] "Alert" when room number is over 100
-->

# Definition of Done
<!--
  Write definition of done. @see https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/definition-of-done/
  Detailed list is good, but our time is finite. Necessary and sufficient.
  
  
e.g. 
- [ ] There is button and we can calculate
- [ ] Unit price: 10,000 yen, Rooms: 10 => Total 100,000 yen
- [ ] Alert with over 100 rooms  
-->

例
- [ ] ボタンが設置され料金計算が正しく行われている（ 10,000円 10部屋で合計が100,000円となる）
- [ ] 100部屋以上の入力でAlertが出ている
